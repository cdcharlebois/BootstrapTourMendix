# IntroJS Walkthrough

Highlight and guide users through new features or explain existing functionality.

### Intstructions

1. Install the widget in your project
2. Include the widget on a page where you want to show a walkthrough
3. Configure the widget's settings:
    1. On the **Walkthrough** tab, add steps:
        1. `Selector` : the name of the Mendix component you'd like to highlight. (optionally use CSS/jQuery selectors here)
        2. `Selector is Name` : if you used a CSS/jQuery selector in the first step, select "no" here. Otherwise, keep "yes"
        3. `Text` : the text to display in the helper popover next to the component you're highlighting.
        4. `Position` : where (relative to the component) should the popover appear?
    2. On the **Appearance** tab, add the Button Text and Error Message
